## Box Bar Events website 
I have designed a website to help advertise a mobile trailer bar that can be hired out for weddings, parties, festivals. The website provides descrivtive text on how the company started, the different packages they can provide and also how someone is able to book the mobile bar for one of thier events along with images so the user is able to see what the bar looks like. 

## Design Descisions 
**Page Heading**
For the heading of the page I used an image of the box bar to instantly show the user what the website is for without them even needing to read any words. I the used a large heading to show the company name and a subheading underneath for a desicription of what the website is about so the user isntantly knows what the website is for when they land on the page. 

**Colours**
I decided to keep the design of the website as simple as possible, I used a light grey background (the same colour as the mobile bar). For all text blocks i have used a white background with a black font to make the text clear and easy to read. 

**Navigation**
I have a simple navigation under the title of every page, with the items in the navigation in the same order on every page to make it easy for the user to switch between pages. I used page anchors to make this possible and had every new page open within the same tab.

**Image Gallery**
I have provided an image gallery on the first page to help attract the users attention for them to want to find out more information on how to hire the mobile bar. 

**Screensizes**
To help keep the website as scaleable as possible I have used % instead of px for most of my sizing to make sure that the website will still look good no matter what screen size the user is on. I have also used display flex to help with the positioning on the page.

**Image links to external pages**
On the contact page I used images of the logos for facebook and instagram to take the user to the social media pages for the company, I again did this by using anchors but i had these links open in a new tab.

## Testing:
HTML - I have ran all my HTML pages through the `W3C
validator` and have fixed all errors. 

CSS - I have ran my CSS file through the `Jigsaw validator` and had no errors. 

I have also mamually tested the site.

## Running the application locally:
To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.
